                <br>
                The United Grand Lodge of England reports that worldwide membership totals more than 6 million Freemasons, 1.1 million
                of whom are in North America. With 68,000 Masons and 440 local Lodges, Ohio has one of the largest Masonic memberships
                of any state in the country. <a href="https://www.freemason.com/what-is-freemasonry/">Reference>></a></p></li>

                        The earliest masonic texts each contain some sort of a history of the craft of masonry. The oldest known work of this
                        type, The Halliwell Manuscript, also known as Regius Poem, dates from between 1390 and 1425. This document has a brief
                        history in its introduction, stating that the "craft of masonry" began with Euclid in Egypt, and came to England in the
                        reign of King Athelstan (924â€“939).

                    The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the
                    regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There
                    is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they
                    do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">Reference>></a></li>

                        <br>
                        There are Masonic conspiracy theories dealing with every aspect of society. The majority of these theories are based on
                        one or more of the following assumptions:
                        <br>
                        That Freemasonry is its own religion, requires belief in a unique Masonic god, and that belief in this Masonic god is
                        contrary to the teachings of various mainstream religions (although usually noted in terms of being specifically
                        contrary to Christian belief) <br>
                        That the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite is more than an honorary degree, coupled with the belief that most Freemasons
                        are unaware of hidden or secretive ruling bodies within their organization that govern them, conduct occult ritual, or
                        control various positions of governmental power. 
                        <br>
                        That there is a centralized worldwide body that controls all Masonic Grand Lodges, and thus, all of Freemasonry
                        worldwide acts in a unified manner.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All of these are undeniably untrue. A Mason is someone who has chosen to take a self journey, and learn to improve themselves through Masonry.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These Masons are multi-war Veterans, some are simply people who love and want to serve their community in anyway. From St. Judes, to your local lodge. The only control they have over, is themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But, no Mason stands alone. Neither in the dark nor The Light.
